SIR WALTER RALEIGH, 1602

As the seventeenth century dawned, scarcely a

hundred years after  Columbus s momentous     landfall, the face of much of the New World had already been profoundly transformed. European       crops and livestock had begun to alter the very land- scape, touching off an ecological revolution that    would reverberate for centuries to come. From Tierra del Fuego in the south to Hudson Bay in the north, disease and armed conquest had cruelly win-      nowed and disrupted the native peoples. Several    hundred thousand enslaved  Africans toiled on    Caribbean and Brazilian sugar plantations. From Florida and New Mexico southward, most of the New    World lay firmly within the grip of imperial Spain.

But North America in 1600 remained largely unexplored and effectively unclaimed by Euro- peans. Then, as if to herald the coming century of colonization and conflict in the northern continent,

three European powers planted three primitive out- posts in three distant corners of the continent within three years of one another: the Spanish at Santa Fe in 1610, the French at Quebec in 1608, and, most consequentially for the future United States, the English at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607.

Feeble indeed were England s efforts in the 1500s to compete with the sprawling Spanish Empire.  As Spain s ally in the first half of the century, England took little interest in establishing its own overseas colonies. Religious conflict, moreover, disrupted England in midcentury, after King Henry VIII broke with the Roman  Catholic  Church in the 1530s,

launching the English Protestant Reformation. Catholics battled Protestants for decades, and the religious balance of power seesawed. But after the Protestant Elizabeth ascended to the English throne in 1558, Protestantism became dominant in Eng- land, and rivalry with Catholic Spain intensified.

Ireland, which nominally had been under English rule since the twelfth century, became an early scene of that rivalry. The Catholic Irish sought help from Catholic Spain to throw off the yoke of the new Protestant English queen. But Spanish aid never amounted to much; in the 1570s and 1580s, Elizabeth s troops crushed the  Irish uprising with terrible ferocity, inflicting unspeakable atrocities upon the native  Irish people. The English crown confiscated Catholic Irish lands and planted them with new Protestant landlords from Scotland and England. This policy also planted the seeds of the centuries-old religious conflicts that persist in Ire- land to the present day. Many English soldiers developed in Ireland a sneering contempt for the

savage natives, an attitude that they brought with them to the New World.

26  CHAPTER 2 The Planting of English America, 1500—1733

Encouraged by the ambitious Queen Elizabeth, hardy English buccaneers now swarmed out upon the shipping lanes. They sought to promote the twin goals of Protestantism and plunder by seizing Span- ish treasure ships and raiding Spanish settlements, even though England and Spain were technically at peace. The most famous of these semipiratical sea dogs was the courtly Francis Drake. He plundered his way around the planet, returning in 1580 with his ship heavily ballasted with Spanish booty. The venture netted profits of about 4,600 percent to his financial backers, among whom, in secret, was Queen Elizabeth. Defying Spanish protest, she brazenly knighted Drake on the deck of his barna- cled ship.

The bleak coast of Newfoundland was the scene      of the first English attempt at colonization. This effort collapsed when its promoter, Sir Humphrey      Gilbert, lost his life at sea in 1583. Gilbert s ill-starred dream inspired his gallant half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh to try again in warmer climes. Raleigh organized an expedition that first landed in 1585 on    North  Carolina s Roanoke  Island, off the coast of

Virginia a vaguely defined region named in honor of Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen. After several false starts, the hapless Roanoke colony mysteriously vanished, swallowed up by the wilderness.

These pathetic English failures at colonization contrasted embarrassingly with the glories of the Spanish Empire, whose profits were fabulously enriching Spain. Philip II of Spain, self-anointed foe of the Protestant Reformation, used part of his imperial gains to amass an  Invincible Armada of ships for an invasion of England. The showdown came in 1588, when the lumbering Spanish flotilla, 130 strong, hove into the English  Channel. The English sea dogs fought back. Using craft that were swifter, more maneuverable, and more ably manned, they inflicted heavy damage on the cum - bersome, overladen Spanish ships. Then a devastat- ing storm arose (the Protestant wind ), scattering the crippled Spanish fleet.

The rout of the Spanish  Armada marked the beginning of the end of Spanish imperial dreams, though Spain s New World empire would not fully collapse for three more centuries. Within a few

to the American people. Indeed England now had many of the characteristics that Spain displayed on the eve of its colonizing adventure a century earlier: a strong, unified national state under a popular monarch; a measure of religious unity after a pro- tracted struggle between Protestants and Catholics; and a vibrant sense of nationalism and national destiny.

A  wondrous flowering of the English national spirit bloomed in the wake of the Spanish Armada s defeat.  A  golden age of literature dawned in this exhilarating atmosphere, with Shakespeare, at its forefront, making occasional poetical references to England s  American colonies. The English were seized with restlessness, with thirst for adventure, and with curiosity about the unknown. Everywhere there blossomed a new spirit of self-confidence, of vibrant patriotism, and of boundless faith in the future of the English nation. When England and Spain finally signed a treaty of peace in 1604, the English people were poised to plunge headlong into the planting of their own colonial empire in the New World.

England s scepter d isle, as Shakespeare called it,

throbbed with social and economic change as the

seventeenth century opened.  Its population was

mushrooming, from some 3 million people in 1550

to about 4 million in 1600. In the ever-green English

countryside, landlords were enclosing croplands

for sheep grazing, forcing many small farmers into

precarious tenancy or off the land altogether. It was

In the years immediately following the defeat ![](Aspose.Words.8470756a-fbc2-4aff-8f3b-6df959e5d1a1.004.png)![](Aspose.Words.8470756a-fbc2-4aff-8f3b-6df959e5d1a1.005.png)of the Spanish Armada, the English writer Richard Hakluyt (1552?—1616) extravagantly exhorted his countrymen to cast off their

sluggish security and undertake the colonization of the New World:

There is under our noses the great and

ample country of Virginia; the inland whereof is found of late to be so sweet and wholesome a climate, so rich and abundant in silver mines, a better and richer country than Mexico itself. If it shall please the Almighty to stir up Her Majestys heart to continue with transporting one or two thousand of her people, she shall by God s assistance, in short space, increase her dominions, enrich her coffers, and reduce many pagans to the faith of Christ.

At  the same time, laws of primogeniture de- creed that only eldest sons were eligible to inherit landed estates. Landholders ambitious younger sons, among them Gilbert, Raleigh, and Drake, were forced to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Bad luck plagued their early, lone-wolf enterprises. But by the early 1600s, the joint-stock company, forerunner of the modern corporation, was perfected. It enabled a considerable number of investors, called adventur- ers, to pool their capital.

Peace with a chastened Spain provided the opportunity for English colonization. Population growth provided the workers. Unemployment, as well as a thirst for adventure, for markets, and for religious freedom, provided the motives. Joint-stock companies provided the financial means. The stage was now set for a historic effort to establish an English beachhead in the still uncharted North American wilderness.

England Plants the Jamestown Seedling![ref1]

In 1606, two years after peace with Spain, the hand of destiny beckoned toward Virginia. A joint-stock company, known as the Virginia Company of Lon-

don, received a charter from King James I of Eng- land for a settlement in the New World. The main attraction was the promise of gold, combined with a strong desire to find a passage through America to the Indies. Like most joint-stock companies of the day, the Virginia Company was intended to endure for only a few years, after which its stockholders hoped to liquidate it for a profit. This arrangement put severe pressure on the luckless colonists, who were threatened with abandonment in the wilder- ness if they did not quickly strike it rich on the com - pany s behalf. Few of the investors thought in terms of long-term colonization. Apparently no one even faintly suspected that the seeds of a mighty nation were being planted.

The charter of the Virginia Company is a signifi- cant document in American history. It guaranteed to the overseas settlers the same rights of English- men that they would have enjoyed if they had stayed at home. This precious boon was gradually extended to subsequent English colonies, helping to reinforce the colonists sense that even on the far shores of the Atlantic, they remained comfortably within the embrace of traditional English institu-

Disease continued to reap a gruesome harvest among the Virginians. By 1625 Virginia contained only some twelve hundred hard-bitten survivors of the nearly eight thousand adventurers who had tried to start life anew in the ill-fated colony.

Cultural Clash in the Chesapeake![ref1]

When the English landed in 1607, the chieftain Powhatan dominated the native peoples living in the James River area. He had asserted supremacy over a few dozen small tribes, loosely affiliated in what somewhat grandly came to be called Pow- hatan s Confederacy. The English colonists dubbed all the local  Indians, somewhat inaccurately, the Powhatans. Powhatan at first may have considered the English potential allies in his struggle to extend his power still further over his Indian rivals, and he tried to be conciliatory. But relations between the Indians and the English remained tense, especially as the starving colonists took to raiding Indian food supplies.

The Powhatans also despite the apparent cohesiveness of Powhatan s Confederacy lacked the unity with which to make effective opposition to the comparatively well-organized and militarily dis- ciplined whites. Finally, unlike the  Indians whom the Spaniards had encountered to the south, who could be put to work in the mines and had gold and silver to trade, the Powhatans served no economic function for the Virginia colonists. They provided no reliable labor source and, after the Virginians began growing their own food crops, had no valuable com - modities to offer in commerce. The natives there- fore could be disposed of without harm to the colonial economy. Indeed the Indian presence frus- trated the colonists desire for a local commodity the Europeans desperately wanted: land.

The Indians New World![ref1]

The fate of the Powhatans foreshadowed the des- tinies of indigenous peoples throughout the conti- nent as the process of European settlement went forward. Native Americans, of course, had a history well before  Columbus s arrival. They were no strangers to change, adaptation, and even catastro- phe, as the rise and decline of civilizations such as the Mississippians and the Anasazis demonstrated. But the shock of large-scale European colonization disrupted Native  American life on a vast scale, inducing unprecedented demographic and cultural transformations.

Yet blacks were too costly for most of the hard-pinched white colonists to acquire, and for decades few were brought to Vir- ginia.

Representative self-government was also born in primitive Virginia, in the same cradle with slavery and in the same year 1619. The London Company authorized the settlers to summon an assembly, known as the House of Burgesses.  A  momentous precedent was thus feebly established, for this assemblage was the first of many miniature parlia- ments to flourish in the soil of America.

As time passed, James I grew increasingly hos- tile to Virginia. He detested tobacco, and he dis- trusted the representative House of Burgesses, which he branded a seminary of sedition.  In 1624 he revoked the charter of the bankrupt and belea- guered Virginia  Company, thus making Virginia a royal colony directly under his control.

The profitable sugar-plantation system soon

on the North American mainland for foodstuffs and

Barbados arrived in Carolina in 1670. They brought

with them a few African slaves, as well as the model

of the Barbados slave code, which eventually

inspired statutes governing slavery throughout the
