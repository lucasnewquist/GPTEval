As the seventeenth century began, the New World had already undergone significant changes. European crops and livestock had transformed the landscape, and the native peoples had been greatly impacted by disease and conquest. By 1600, North America was largely unexplored and unclaimed by Europeans. However, within three years of each other, three European powers established outposts: the Spanish at Santa Fe in 1610, the French at Quebec in 1608, and the English at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.

England's efforts to establish overseas colonies had been feeble in the 1500s, with little interest in competing with the Spanish Empire. However, the Protestant Reformation and tensions with Catholic Spain changed the course of English colonization. The English crown confiscated Catholic Irish lands and planted them with Protestant landlords, which planted the seeds of religious conflict that continue to this day.

Encouraged by Queen Elizabeth, English buccaneers sought to promote Protestantism and plunder by raiding Spanish settlements and seizing treasure ships, even during peacetime. Sir Francis Drake, the most famous of these sea dogs, returned in 1580 with enormous profits for his backers, including the queen. English efforts at colonization initially failed, but Sir Walter Raleigh organized a successful expedition to Roanoke Island in 1585. However, the Roanoke colony mysteriously vanished.

England's victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 marked the beginning of the end of Spanish imperial dreams. This victory gave England a sense of national pride, self-confidence, and a thirst for adventure. When peace with Spain was finally signed in 1604, England was ready to establish its own colonial empire.

England's population was growing rapidly, reaching 4 million by 1600. Landlords were enclosing croplands, forcing many small farmers off the land. Woolen districts, where Puritanism had taken root, supplied many of the earliest immigrants to America. Economic depression in the woolen trade led to thousands of unemployed farmers taking to the roads.

In 1606, the Virginia Company of London received a charter from King James I to establish a settlement in the New World. The main attraction was the promise of gold and a passage to the Indies. The first English settlers arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. However, the early years of Jamestown were filled with hardships, including disease, starvation, and conflicts with Native Americans. By 1625, only 1,200 survivors remained out of nearly 8,000 adventurers.

The arrival of John Rolfe and the successful cultivation of tobacco saved the struggling colony. Tobacco became Virginia's most profitable export and laid the foundation for the colony's economic success. The demand for tobacco led to an increased demand for labor, and African slaves were brought to the colony.

Maryland, founded in 1634 by Lord Baltimore, became a haven for Catholics. Protestant England was still persecuting Catholics, and Lord Baltimore established Maryland as a refuge for his fellow Catholics. The Act of Toleration, passed in 1649, granted religious toleration to all Christians but imposed the death penalty for those who denied the divinity of Jesus.

The Carolina colony, founded in 1670, was intended to serve as a buffer between Spanish Florida and the valuable Carolinas. Carolina prospered by developing close economic ties with the West Indies, particularly in the sugar trade. However, tensions between white settlers and Native Americans led to conflicts, including the Yamasee War in 1715.

The last of the plantation colonies, Georgia, was founded in 1733 as a haven for debtors and a buffer against Spanish Florida. Initially, Georgia aimed to exclude slavery, but the colony eventually embraced the institution.

In summary, the planting of English America began with feeble efforts in the 1500s but gained momentum in the early seventeenth century. The colonies faced numerous challenges, including disease, conflicts with Native Americans, and economic struggles. However, the colonies grew and developed an aristocratic and plantation-based society reliant on staple crops such as tobacco and rice. The colonies also experienced the introduction of African slavery, which became vital to their economic success.
